My Crafts Manager
A React project that displays materials (beads, threads and patterns) for cross stitching. The project uses Material UI for display. The project links to pictures of materials from various craft stores.


The purpose of the app is to allow a stitcher to search, update and view different materials. 

A search function is being built.
